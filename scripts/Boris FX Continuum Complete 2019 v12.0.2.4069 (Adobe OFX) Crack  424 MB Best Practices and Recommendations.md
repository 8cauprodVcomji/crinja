## Particle Illusion
  
One of the most exciting new features in Continuum 2019 is the rebirth of Particle Illusion, the famed motion graphics generator that allows editors and artists to create preset-driven photorealistic motion-tracked particle effects for titles, lower thirds, and background graphics. Particle Illusion has been redesigned from the ground up as a 64-bit application, with a new interface, new emitter library, new behaviors, and new presets. Users can also customize their own particle effects from scratch or modify existing ones with the powerful graph editor.
  
## Mocha Essentials
  
Mocha is the Academy Award-winning planar tracking and masking application that is integrated inside almost every single filter in Continuum. The Continuum 2019 release provides some major updates to Mocha, such as a new Mocha Essentials workspace with 4 new spline tools like magnetic edge snapping and geometric shapes for faster tracking and masking, new point-driven parameter tracking powered by Mocha, and overall GPU-acceleration. These enhancements make it easier and faster for users to do more advanced finishing work right within the filter without having to leave editing project timelines.
  
## Title Studio
  
Title Studio is a next-gen 2D/3D titling plug-in that can be used as a custom interface plug-in or standalone application. It enables users to easily create high-quality professional 2D or 3D titles with custom bevels, fills and styles; import 3D models from Maxon C4D or Adobe Illustrator EPS files; and add OpenGL-accelerated features like 3D extrusions, materials, cameras, lights, and deformers. Title Studio also supports external broadcast monitor support, deep color 32-bit support in Premiere Pro, and new image-processing shaders such as glows, rays, and blurs for visually-stunning titles and lower thirds.
  
## Other Improvements
  
Besides these major features, Continuum 2019 also offers many other improvements such as:

- Avid Effects Simplified: The introduction of Mocha-based parameter tracking renders most non-real time blue dot filters unnecessary. Non-real time filters have been moved into an obsolete folder to support the older legacy Continuum tracker.
- Deep Color 32-bit Support in Premiere Pro: The 32-bit float color processing option in Continuum, which has always been available in hosts such as After Effects, has been extended to include the Premiere Pro host with deep color support enabling users to generate HDR content without clipping.
- Over 80 New Presets: Continuum 2019 adds over 80 new professionally-designed presets across various filters such as Film Style, Image Restoration, Lights, Particles, Perspective, Stylize, and Transitions.

## Conclusion
  
Boris FX Continuum Complete 2019 v12.0.2.4069 (Adobe OFX) Crack is a comprehensive plug-in collection that offers a wide range of creative effects, titling, and quick-fix tools for video editing. It is compatible with Adobe After Effects, Premiere Pro, and other OFX hosts.
